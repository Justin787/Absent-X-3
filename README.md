# Absent-X-3
This game is the first 3D game I made. This was created in my AP Computer Science class during my junior year of high school. The player is a cube with a child who's name is a math joke, X^3+2 (in algebra the a cubic function, X^3, is the parent function of X^3+2). The object of the game is to get rid of the child and avoid it for seven seconds.  It seems fairly simple, but very few can manage to do it.
